# MMAML-TSR
## Multi-modal meta-learning for time series regression

This repo contains the implementation of the paper (\*) which adapts MAML ([Finn et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf)) and MMAML ([Vuorio et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13616.pdf)) to Time Series Regression. 

### Dependencies

* Python 3.7.0
* Pytorch 1.4.0
* Learn2learn 0.1.1

### Data

The code can be used  on two open datasets that need to be pre-processed before running MAML or MMAML. The data is available such that:

* **Air pollution Dataset**: [PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PM2.5+Data+of+Five+Chinese+Cities).

* **Heart rate Dataset**: [PPG-DaLiA Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PPG-DaLiA).
